# Requirement Analysis in Software Development  

## ðŸ“– Introduction  
This repository is dedicated to documenting the **Requirement Analysis** phase of software development. It serves as a structured reference for understanding how project needs are gathered, analyzed, and transformed into detailed documentation and diagrams.  

The purpose of this repository is to:  
- Provide a hands-on example of requirement analysis for a **Booking Management System**.  
- Demonstrate how to define **functional and non-functional requirements**.  
- Show how to use diagrams to represent **system actors and interactions**.  
- Establish **acceptance criteria** that align with user and business goals.  

This project is part of a learning exercise to apply industry-standard practices in requirement analysis, ensuring clarity, structure, and precision in software development.
