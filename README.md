# Requirement Analysis in Software Development  

## ðŸ“– Introduction  
This repository is dedicated to documenting the **Requirement Analysis** phase of software development. It serves as a structured reference for understanding how project needs are gathered, analyzed, and transformed into detailed documentation and diagrams.  

The purpose of this repository is to:  
- Provide a hands-on example of requirement analysis for a **Booking Management System**.  
- Demonstrate how to define **functional and non-functional requirements**.  
- Show how to use diagrams to represent **system actors and interactions**.  
- Establish **acceptance criteria** that align with user and business goals.  

This project is part of a learning exercise to apply industry-standard practices in requirement analysis, ensuring clarity, structure, and precision in software development.  
## ðŸ”‘ Why is Requirement Analysis Important?  

Requirement Analysis is a cornerstone of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it ensures the project starts with a clear direction and understanding. Its importance lies in the following:  

1. **Prevents Miscommunication**  
   - By clearly documenting requirements, all stakeholders (clients, developers, testers, and project managers) share the same understanding of the system. This reduces confusion and aligns everyone toward the same goal.  

2. **Saves Time and Cost**  
   - Identifying requirements early helps avoid costly redesigns or fixes later in development. A well-done requirement analysis reduces the risk of rework and project delays.  

3. **Defines Clear Success Criteria**  
   - Requirement analysis establishes measurable acceptance criteria, ensuring that the final product can be validated against user and business needs. This provides a benchmark for project success.
